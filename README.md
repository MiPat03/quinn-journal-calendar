## Design Choices

1. **Pure CSS**: No UI framework dependency for smaller bundle size
2. **Memory Efficient**: Limits DOM nodes to prevent performance degradation
3. **Accessibility First**: Built with screen readers and keyboard navigation in mind
4. **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-first design with responsive breakpoints
5. **Performance Focused**: Every interaction is optimized for 60fps smoothness
